# How to set things up?

## Create the accounts and get the website

        - You will have to create a team. We don't really care, it's you only, `team01` is enough.
    1. Create a website for the fork of this repo in repo.
        - You will have to accept the linking to your previously created github account
        - You will have to select the git repo you just created.
1. Done.
    - You will find your new website in netlify, the list under `Sites`. Once selected, a bit under the title.
    - The address is generated by netlity, you can change it if you own a domain name.
    - Any change to the files will be shown on the website in a matter of minutes. You will see on netlify that `build`s are triggered automatically to generate it.
